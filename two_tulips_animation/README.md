# Two Flowers Animation
This is an animation based on a [botanical work](https://www.rijksmuseum.nl/en/collection/RP-T-1951-330) by Jan Jansz van der Vinne, dated between 1744 and 1805, which is in the collection of the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam.

This animation was inspired by the [animation projects of Simone Seagle](http://tangerinedev.com/play/cat-watching-spider), who has made lovely works with open sources images in the Met's collection. I used Gimp to complete the project.
